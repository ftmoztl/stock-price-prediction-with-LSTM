# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

In today's era, financial forecasts have gained significant popularity. Numerous models are being utilized to develop prediction systems for various assets such as stocks, currencies, and cryptocurrencies. The primary objective is to make informed decisions, whether to buy or sell, in order to maximize profits or asset value. Decision support systems are now being built using the capabilities of machine learning to generate accurate predictions for future financial outcomes.

For this repository, 3 big companies' stock prices, Apple, Samsung, and Xiaomi are used to predict their next 7 days stock prices. The LSTM algorithm is used for prediction. So, 3 different algorithms are created for each company.
